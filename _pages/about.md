<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Central South University (CSU). I have secured a spot for a Direct Ph.D. program at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS) through the academic recommendation process.

I was awarded the First-Class Scholarship and the Corporate Scholarship at Central South University. My competitive achievements include the National First Prize in the RoboCup China Open Intelligent Vehicle Challenge (2025), along with two other national-level, one regional-level, and one provincial-level competition awards.

I previously served as a member of the Student Union Standing Committee for the School of Electronic Information Engineering at CSU, and as the Cohort Leader for the 2022 cohort.

My research interest includes Vison Language Model, Reinfore Learning and Embodied AI.
